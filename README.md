# Advent of Code (2019) Solutions
As per usual I've done these in Python. I'm still getting used to the new features but I tried to incorporate them as much as possible. One feature I didn't get to use use `dataclass` which seems extremely useful but also somewhat of a pain. I'll see if this year I can use a new language (I'm thinking Rust/Lisp/Perl maybe) to get out of my depth a bit. But also, I haven't really gotten completely comfortable with all the puzzles so I may have to mix a couple different choices. I guess you'll see in a year or so. 

There are minimal comments but my focus was on self-documenting code (design and naming should be very similar to problem spec) in addtion to speed (got the leaderboard a couple nights so that was nice). The scaffolding/template generation and auto-downloading features were designed for AoC 2018, which I still have one last puzzle to solve. But my solutions for that will be up soon. I may have to redesign it a bit since VS Code doesn't like that I'm working on python files from sub folders (when dealing with error messages and stuff) but it's more than good enough imo.
